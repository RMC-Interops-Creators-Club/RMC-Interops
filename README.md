# Tactical-Intervention - RMC's Edit

A modified version of Arctic's Tactical Invervention weapon pack that aims to improve the core weapon base, improve gameplay and add new features and content for a more enjoyable experience.  This includes redone stats, a new customization UI, new weapons and features backported from Tactical RP.

Features:
- New content: All of the extra weapons from TacRP have been backported, new weapons such as the VSS and P226, tac laser and radar attachments and restored knives.
    All new weapons:
    - VSS Vintorez - Integrally-suppressed sniper with good mobility but poor damage and spread.
    - P226 - .357 SIG pistol that maintains its damage over long ranges.
    - Desert Eagle - A powerful but cumbersome magnum pistol with amazing damage.
    - Tactical Knife and Jackal Knife - Backup melee weapons that can make quick work of opponents if you're out of ammo.
    
- Complete rebalance: All weapon and attachment stats have been rebalanced for a more enjoyable experience with more gameplay variety.
- New customization UI: Simplified stats page and the ability to see attachment pros and cons, spread now measured in degrees.
